# cwlib-rs
## A rust-based library for dealing with assets from the Craftworld engine used by the LittleBigPlanet series

Right now this is very minimal, It can serialize and deserialize FileDB GUID maps.
I plan on using this to read data out of (and hopefully eventually write data into) a matching File ARChive.

I would like to write some reference documentation at some point on how to use this library, but right now it's so barebones that it's frankly not worth the time to even try using it for anything serious.
